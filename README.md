# this is a meme platform, for companies
basically just a place for you to put your memes on, since nobody outside your company would understand them anyways. features uploads, comments, likes, jifs, static images, movies and just text based memes.

only allow people form your domain to access the platform, you can even add multiple as well as having a manual pending verification process to check additional domains that should not be auto accepted.

# ðŸš§ THIS PROJECT IS A WIP
- use valet to setup this project with ssl
- run `docker-compose up -d` to get db and redis
- goto your valet defined domain
- start working
